       " ['30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb\\n\\nI\\'m glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.\\n\\nDisclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:\\n\\nWe were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention?  Here goes:\\n\\n1.\\t\\u2060\\u2060Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We\\'ve been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We\\'ve been seeing these movements all week.\\n2.\\t\\u2060\\u2060Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn\\'t work.\\n3.\\t\\u2060\\u2060Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.\\n4.\\t\\u2060\\u2060Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.\\n5.\\t\\u2060\\u2060At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.\\n6.\\t\\u2060\\u2060Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.\\n7.\\t\\u2060\\u2060The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.\\n\\nOkay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn\\'t let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.\\n\\nI saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that\\'s true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.\\n\\nHow do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That\\'s what a liquidity crisis is.\\n\\nListen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn\\'t have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO \"PROTECT THE MARKET\"? Hello!  He\\'s not talking about the market for GME shares.  He\\'s talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.\\n\\nRemember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o\\n\\nIt kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It\\'s the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.\\n\\nTL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, \"Do I get my tendies now?\" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, \"They\\'re out of bullets!\" and create a stampede.  That\\'s how we win.\\n\\nThey needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I\\'m not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.\\n\\nCredit: u/PlayFree_Bird',\n",

I took out a much larger position in our options on companies like BYND. My reasoning being, that if Robinhood was going to fuck us all in the ass, many would leave the platform and this would likely result in a huge amount of shares being sold in the stocks most commonly owned by Robinhood traders. My trades were working well for me. Now that Robinhood has partially and arbitrarily reversed course; the underlying stocks have arbitrarily rebounded. \\n\\nI cannot be alone here. Robinhood has completely and arbitrarily rigged an entire portion of the market. First causing an arbitrary crash. Then, after their partners were given time to exit short positions; they haphazardly reverse course. The people trading as a hobby (like me) were absolutely trounced today. \\n\\nNow, if these market moves were the result of anything even remotely approaching economic or unmanipulated market  factors, I would not complain.

I tried posting it here, but Reddit isn’t letting me. \\n\\n\\n> [Salutation]\\n\\n> The brokerage Robinhood has manipulated the stock market by allowing only sells (and disallowing buys) on some of the highest volume stocks on the market this week (e.g. GME, AMC).  It would also appear that Robinhood has a financial conflict of interest given its dependency on Citadel, who has a financial interest in seeing some of these shares decline. Obviously if investors can only sell (and not buy) a particular stock, that stock will decline in value. \\n\\n\\n\\n> Allowing brokerages to arbitrarily place their thumb on the scales of the stock market will only serve to reduce liquidity on the market, which will in turn lead to lower valuations and performance of the overall market. Rather than serving as a neutral intermediary, this puts brokerages in the position of picking winners and losers.  Taken to its extreme, this policy would fragment the stock market like the current video streaming market.  Investors would have to research which brokers permit them to trade a particular stock, which is obviously ridiculous. \\n\\n\\n\\n> The stock market is supposed to be transparent and fair for all investors. Allowing brokerages to arbitrarily restrict the purchase and sale of securities is terrible policy and likely illegal. \\n\\n\\n> Please launch an investigation into Robinhood immediately. \\n\\n\\n\\n> [Closing]',\n",

As everyone here knows, DFV posted his initial DD back in JULY!!!, and GME has been discussed on this forum as a LONG play (and derided by many who doubted DFV) for the better part of a year now. Many on here took positions long ago. Others (like me) finally got in after seeing that the thesis was bearing out, and after things developed with Ryan Cohen joining the Gamestop board, seeing fundamentals that made it seem like a good bet, etc. There was no agreement at any point for everyone to just go in on this, but the narrative makes it sound like we are some kind of coordinated mob that just decided recently to go all in here; and that incorrect narrative is causing some unfair misconception and flat out wrong reporting about this sub and about the overall story. Each person decided when to buy shares when they personally decided it was something they wanted to risk. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBut anyway, I\\'m not sure what my point is, other than I\\'m glad I decided to buy shares, and then decided to do an all in play on this. At this point I feel like the only way we can lose is if false reporting continues and if Wall Street is able to continue manipulating the market and fucking retail over.
